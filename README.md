# Path2Zero
- Our platform provides a secure and transparent system to authenticate, trade, and permanently retire verified carbon credits — turning carbon offsets into provable climate action, not unchecked claims.
- We address one of the most critical failures of today’s carbon markets: opacity and double counting. By digitally validating carbon credit certificates, enforcing identity verification, and maintaining an auditable record of every transaction, we ensure accountability from upload to retirement.
- By unifying certificate authentication, a verified marketplace, and end-to-end traceability, we transform carbon credits into a credible, accountable, and data-driven instrument for real climate-resilient impact.
